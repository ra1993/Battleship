#### Battleship Game

Battleship Game:

In this project you will build a version of the classic board game Battleship!

#### Battleship

* The gameboard is a grid of squares. The contents of the squares are hidden from the player.

* The grid contains one or more "ships" which occupy tiles. In the simple game, a ship is a single tile big, in the full version of the game, they are short horizontal or vertical rows.

* The player attempts to attack a grid location. They are told if the attack is a miss or a hit. If all of the squares of all of the ships are hit, the player wins.

* In the two-player version of the game, the players place thier ships at the beginning of the game and then take turns attacking squares. The first player to hit all of their opponent's squares wins the game.

#### Simplified Game

* In the simple version of the game, there will be a 5x5 grid with a single "ship" that is one tile large, placed on a random tile.

* The user will be asked to guess until they hit the tile. The user will then be told how many guesses they made.

* After the user makes a guess, they see a representation of the board that indicates where they have already guessed.

* You will create a class representing the game board. A separate python file will provide the interface for the user.

* HINT: try using `os.system('clear')` to clear the terminal between inputs

#### The gameboard class

* The gameboard should contain an internal representation of the state of the game, including where the ship is placed and where the player has guessed.

* It should have methods for guessing an attack location. What other methods will it need? What should ```__init__``` set? What properties will this object need to have?

#### Ideas for expanding the game:

* You may need to create subclasses of your original gameboard class to implement these features.

* Have multiple ships, and ships that are of varying lengths.

    * In the real game of battleship, the grid is 11x11 and the ships are one tile wide, but multiple tiles long. There is a 1x2 ship, two 1x3 ships, a 1x4 ship, and a 1x5 ship.

* Allow two players to play.

    * Either place the ships randomly or create an interface for players to place their own ships.

    * Allow the players to take turns guessing until one has sunk all of the others ships. Each turn they should see a representation of what they know about the other's board (where they have missed and hit) and a representation of their own board that shows ship locations and where misses and hits from the other player have happened.

* Create a computer opponent that guesses randomly.

* Improve the computer opponent's strategy
